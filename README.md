##Overview
The submission contains a simple motor shield sketch that spins the wheels attached to the motor 180 degrees then delaying 1 second before it turns 180 degrees again.The project is still in its first stages and still waiting on a motorshield to arrive.
 
##Setup
To aide in this explatory project I decided to attach a motorshield to the arduino uno. This will aide in the movement of the dc motors within Wall-E.

##Goals
As of right now,the goal is to get Wall-E to move forward and the code that implements this. The main goal is for Wall-E to demonstrate autonomous movements.

##Critique
Since this is an explatory project, I still have so much to do and learn. Alot of my base codes will come from arduino libraries and forums since coding is also new to me. However, the codes and experiementing with them is a great way to expand my knowledge.
