##Overview
The submission is a final repository for a completed Wall-E exploratory project. Its contents include the final sketch used to give Wall-E autonomous movements of going forward, backward, turning around as well as facial expressions and arm movements.The sketch also allows you to set the speed of the motor using a setSpeed(speed) function, where the speed ranges from 0 (stopped) to 255 (full speed).
 
##Setup
A major aid in the setup of this project was the implementation of an adafruit motor shield which provided suffiecient power to the Wall-E motors.

##Goals
(November) As of right now,the goal is to get Wall-E to move forward and the code implements this. Unfortunately i have been un able to test the code since parts are still in transit. The main goal is to get Wall-E to demonstrate autonomous movements.
(December) Goals were accomplished and project was deemed successful. However the project will continued to be worked on.

##Critique
A critique I have now that the semester has come to an end was the lack of implementing a sensor on my project.
