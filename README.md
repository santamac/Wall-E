##Overview
The submission contains a simple motor shield sketch and when connected moves Wall-E forward and backward.The sketch also allows you to set the speed of the motor using a setSpeed(speed) function, where the speed ranges from 0 (stopped) to 255 (full speed).
 
##Setup
To aide in this explatory project I decided to attach a motorshield to the arduino uno. This will aide in the movement of the dc motors within Wall-E.

##Goals
As of right now,the goal is to get Wall-E to move forward and the code implements this. Unfortunately i have been un able to test the code since parts are still in transit. The main goal is to get Wall-E to demonstrate autonomous movements.

##Critique
Since this is an explatory project, I still have so much to do and learn. Alot of my base codes will come from arduino libraries and forums since coding is also new to me. However, experimenting with the codes is a great way to expand my knowledge.
